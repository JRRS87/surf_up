Surf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

#Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to provide an overview for the temperatures of the months of June and December. 
This data is critical for the analysis of the potential ice cream and surfing startup. The analysis was produced from a 
query of sqlite flat data files containing weather data. The query was run to produce results containing the temperature 
in the months of June and December. This will allow the ownership team to evaluate how the temperature changes between the 
summer and winter seasons. Further, this evaluation will provide good insight on how ice cream sales may fare during these 
periods.

##Main differences between the analysis from June vs. Decembver:

- Overall both data sets are very large totaling between 1700 and 1517 data points respectivley
- Both data sets showed a temp mean of over 70 degrees, however the June temperatures were warmer by about 3 degrees
- The minimum temp was lower in December (not suprisingly) by 9 degrees
- However the maximum temp for the time periods were only different by 2 degrees showing 85 vs. 83 respectiveley
- Although there is a slight difference in smple size I do not beleive it is enough to sway the data in either instance analyzed
